# **Comments:**

There are three main concerns considering the value of this proposal:

1.  Unifying the clarity of [homogeneous hazy]{.underline} (100% frit
    coverage, diffuse laminates, and privacy applied films) with
    [inhomogeneous products]{.underline} that have partial areas without
    any obscuring elements is not intuitive other than that neither of
    them are "perfectly" specular. Maybe this is not a concern if a
    designer is only picking between products in each category, but that
    it would somehow be possible to equate the clarity of a venetian
    blind with something that has a certain level of haze sounds
    confusing.

2.  The scope of the project does not include support for showing that
    the defined metric will be transferable between boundary conditions
    (indoor and outdoor) that are different to those of the human
    testing study that is proposed. It seems unlikely that the variation
    in indoor conditions (distance/angle to window, lighting conditions,
    room colors) will scale the same way for different products.

3.  It is not obvious that the subjectivity of the metric will be
    thoroughly investigated in the proposed study. But as someone who is
    not an expert on human subject studies I lack full confidence in
    this comment.

While being far from perfect, transmitted visual haze and specular
visible transmittance are two product properties that do not incorporate
human subjectivity. Using those metrics (which probably would need to be
measured anyway for this new single subjective number) does not seem
sufficiently worse as a way to quantify clarity that it is necessary to
introduce a new single subjective number.
